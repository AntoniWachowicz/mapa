# Boundary Implementation Approaches

## Ranked from Most Likely to Work to Least Probable

### **1. Use Real OSM Relation Data Properly**
- Stop generating fake coordinate sequences
- Parse the actual OSM relation structure (ways, nodes, member ordering)
- Reconstruct the boundary from the real way geometries in correct sequence
- Handle holes, multi-polygons, and complex topology correctly

### **2. Import Pre-Processed Boundary File**
- Find an existing GeoJSON/Shapefile of Polish gminas
- Simply copy-paste the exact coordinate array from a working file
- No processing, no APIs - just use validated data directly
- Manually inspect the coordinate count and ranges before implementing

### **3. Start with Simple Rectangle + Progressive Refinement**
- Begin with accurate bounding box coordinates for the municipality
- Gradually add more points along the actual boundary
- Validate each step to ensure coordinates stay within expected ranges
- Build up precision incrementally rather than all-at-once

### **4. Use Existing Working Examples**
- Find another mapping application that successfully displays Polish gmina boundaries
- Inspect their network requests to see what data they're using
- Copy their exact coordinate sequences or API endpoints
- Reverse-engineer a working implementation

### **5. Manual Coordinate Extraction**
- Use OpenStreetMap's web interface to manually extract way coordinates
- Follow the boundary relation step-by-step, copying coordinates by hand
- Time-intensive but guarantees accuracy
- No automated processing to introduce errors

### **6. Simplified Approximate Boundary**
- Create a much simpler 20-30 point boundary that's "good enough"
- Focus on getting the general shape right rather than maximum precision
- Manually verify each coordinate point is reasonable
- Prioritize working over perfect

### **7. Different Coordinate Format/Projection**
- The issue might be coordinate system confusion (WGS84 vs Polish coordinate systems)
- Try converting between different projections (EPSG:4326, EPSG:2180, etc.)
- The data might be correct but in wrong projection

### **8. Debug the Current Implementation**
- Add coordinate validation to check ranges before rendering
- Log the actual boundary bounds being calculated
- Verify the polygon is closing properly
- Check if the issue is in coordinate ordering or array structure

## Notes
- The most likely issue is approach #1 - not properly processing real OSM relation data
- Current implementation generates fake coordinates instead of using real boundary data
- Focus on getting actual OSM way geometries and assembling them correctly
